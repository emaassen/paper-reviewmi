These two scales are combined in one measurement model over time (so 2 * 2 factors). ""By means of a confirmatory factor analysis approach, we tested whether a two-factor solution [corresponding to measures of memory performance (MEM) and executive functioning (EXEC)] was reliable over time. Nested models of longitudinal invariance demonstrated the existence of partial strong invariance over time. In other words, this indicates that there is an equivalence of the factorial structure and factor loadings for all items; this was also observed for the item intercepts for all the items, except for one of the items from the EXEC dimension.""",80,1,0,1,NA,NA,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,0,"data shared were results from invariance tests and correlations between MMSE and SRT at different time points, but these are sum scores so we cannot use them for MI checks."

This, unfortunately, is not directly reproducible in R. Note that, we still tried to reproduce the analyses using lavaan, but our results differ from those in the article. Such differences, may be due to the different estimators/models (classical CFA vs BSEM)."
