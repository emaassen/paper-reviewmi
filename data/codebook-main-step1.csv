The groups are not statistically compared; only the scores on the big-5. So I would say no group comparison is made.

These five factors are then compared for all groups. Therefore I split the scales into 5 (with 6 groups makes 30 rows) and coded name_scale with both scales combined. The CBI and PHQ are not investigated separately. Not sure which kind of DIF is found.  The MIMIC was used (and applied to the whole scale) but since the analysis was performed item by item I indicated that an IRT approach was used.

These are the questions: ""which card did you choose"" (1 item) / ""select correct card"" (1 item) / ""significance of 8 cards and 8 control cards"" (so 16 items?) / ""valence of 8 cards and 8 control cards"" (so 16 items?) / ""arousal of 8 cards and 8 control cards"" (so 16 items?) / ""motivation to conceal/reveal"" (1 item) / ""effort to conceal/reveal"" (1 item) / ""effort to inhibit arousal"" (1 item) / ""speed in selecting red or green circles"" (1 item). This means that there are three scales I would say (significance; valence and arousal). The authors also state this; which I don't really understand; but it seems to mean they make mean scores for two variables for each participant: ""Finally; for the decision-phase analyses; two dependent measures were created for each participant and each physiological measure (one for the conceal condition and one for the reveal condition) by averaging the raw scores across categories. In addition; for the CIT-phase analyses; two detection scores were created for each participant and each physiological measure (one for the conceal condition and one for the reveal condition) by averaging the respective z scores of the critical items.
