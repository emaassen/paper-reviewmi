Specifically, 143 separate participants from Mechanical Turk (86 males; Mage = 34.21, SDage = 10.67; 91 White, 52 non-White, 22 missing race data) viewed videos of each actor performing a scripted description of their professional qualifications. Participants then rated the degree to which the actor was intelligent, persuasive, confident, sincere, organized, attractive, likeable, articulate, comfortable, calm, and clear, which were averaged to yield a single measure of positivity Î± = .90."". None of the variables in the dataset seem to correspond to these variables, and the sample size is different as well. It seems that this is a different dataset, but we're not sure."
